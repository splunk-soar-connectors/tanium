<p>Some things to note:<ul><li>The asset configuration parameter <b>port</b> is optional, if not specified the app will use 443. Depending on the Tanium server version, other valid values can be 8443 or 444.</li><li>Actions like <b>terminate process</b> and <b>reboot system</b> work on either an ip address or a host name.</li><li>It has been noticed that Tanium requires the host name to be a FQDN like win7ult32.corp.contoso.com instead of just win7ult32.</li></ul></p>
