<p>Some things to note:<ul><li>The asset configuration parameter <b>port</b> is optional, if not specified the app will use 443. Depending on the Tanium server version, other valid values can be 8443 or 444.</li><li>Actions like <b>terminate process</b> and <b>reboot system</b> work on either an ip address or a host name.</li><li>It has been noticed that Tanium requires the host name to be an FQDN like win7ult32.corp.contoso.com instead of just win7ult32.</li><li>The action parameter timeout_seconds is optional, if not specified the app will use 60 seconds as default value. As intermittently, for some action input parameters, the actions (terminate_process, reboot_system) won't terminate on its own due to the issue in the SDK, it is recommended to provide the <b>timeout_seconds</b> parameter or else the action will be auto-terminated by a default timeout of 60 seconds.</li><li>The below actions when executed, launches an action in the TANIUM server which in turn will execute the command mentioned in the package linked with the action launched on TANIUM.<ul><li>execute action</li><li>reboot system</li><li>terminate process</li></ul></li><li>In action <b>run query</b> the parameter <b>is_parsed</b> must be kept as true if the provided value in the query parameter is a plain manual question being asked to TANIUM and not a saved question. It should be kept as false if the value provided in the query parameter is the display name of already saved question in the TANIUM server</li></ul></p>
